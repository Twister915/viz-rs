/// # Savitzky Golay Smoothing
///
/// This smoothing algorthim is applied to a single frame of data, and will try to fit the curve of
/// the data to a polynomial.
///
/// The algorithm has the following dials to turn:
/// * The degree of the polynomial
/// * The "window size," which is the number of data-points which surround any given point that the
///   algorithm considers.
/// * The order of the polynomial. This should almost always be 0, but in cases where it is not, then
///   the result of smoothing some data is to compute a smoothed Nth derivative of the data with respect
///   to the X axis.
///
/// The math assumes an evenly spaced input, and produces an evenly spaced output.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// You can create an instance of the `SavitzkyGolayConfig` with the three values explained above.
/// There is no recommendation for the window size, except that it must be an odd number greater than 1.
/// The order should often be set to 0. The degree is best when it is set to 2, 3, or 4.
///
/// You can take a `SavitzkyGolyConfig` and get a `SavitzkyGolayMapper`, which can be used with the
/// `Framed` interface to map each frame of data in your pipeline, by calling `.into_mapper()` on your
/// config.
///
/// ## Math During Runtime
///
/// Given some config, a set of coefficients are computed. These coefficients are a N by N matrix where
/// N is the window size.
///
/// Given the following definitions:
/// * `N = window size`
/// * `M = (N - 1) / 2`
/// * `K = length of input and output`
///
/// To smooth input data frames, we convolve the input data and the coefficients. Literally, this means we:
/// * Iterate through the input data (index will be referred to as `i`)
/// * Select one of the rows from the coefficients matrix (defined later)
/// * Multiply & sum pointwise the slices `input[(i - M)..(i + M)]` and `coefficients[0..N]`.
/// * Replace the point at i with the sum you just computed
///
/// In cases where `i - M` would be < 0, or `i + M` would be >= `K`, then we simply slide our window
/// as far as we can, while keeping it's size constant. This means that in the first case, where we
/// are very far to the left, we always select points `0..N` from the input, and on the far right
/// side of the input we always select points `(K - N)..K`.
///
/// Typically, when our input window is not on the extreme right or left, we will use the coefficient
/// row in the middle of the matrix (that is coefficient row with index M). However, in cases where
/// we are on the extreme left, we will use coefficient rows 0..M. For the furthest left, we use row
/// 0, then we use row 1, etc until we reach row M. Once we reach row M, then we use row M until we
/// hit the far right side. Once we approach the far right side, we use row M+1, M+2, M+3 until the
/// input data ends (when we use coefficient row N - 1).
///
/// We refer to the middle coefficient row as `row t=0`. The row to the left of it is `row t=-1`. The
/// row to the right of it is `row t=1`. In general, you can say: Use row t=0, except when the point
/// of interest is not centered in the input window. In those cases you use the coefficient row
/// corresponding with the offset of point of interest from the center of the input window.
///
/// ## Math During Setup
///
/// The coefficient computation is beyond my powers of explanation. However, there are a few things
/// to note:
/// * The setup time scales with some power >2 of the window size, it seems. Keep in mind that the
///   window size is the number of points considered when smoothing any given point. The higher this
///   number, the smoother the data will be. This scales linearly with the input data, but the setup
///   time scales differently. It is important to keep this tradeoff in mind.
/// * The coefficients computed by the black box code (the math I don't understand) does not sum to 1,
///   but since we're multiplying and summing the data by these coefficients, and we don't want to
///   scale the input data at all, we must normalize each coefficient row so that it sums to 1.
